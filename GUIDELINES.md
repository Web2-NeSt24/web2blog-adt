# Backend
## Endpoints
### Groups
- Related endpoints are grouped in `./blog_api/views/<group-name>.py`
- Add group to imports in `./blog_api/views/__init__.py`

### Errors
- `401 Unauthorized` Returned always if and only if the request required a session cookie, but it was not provided or invalid
- Errors originating from user input:
    - `views.Response({ "error": "Details about error" }, status=status.HTTP_4XX_SOME_ERROR)`
- Serialization errors (Frontend made request with incorrect schema)
    - Not handled explicitly for simplicity, since they cant be caused by the user
    - We can view the serialization error in the devtools if things break
    - Use `serializer.is_valid(raise_exception=True)` to raise an exception when the frontend messed up

### API Documentation
- Automatically generated by `drf-spectacular`
- Can be viewed on URL `/api/swagger-ui/`
- Document endpoints with `@extend_schema` (Must be placed above `@api_view` when using function based views)
    - ```py
        @extend_schema(
            request=<Request Serializer>,
            responses={ 
                200: <Success Response Serializer>,
                200: None, # When no data is returned
                # Error responses
                4xx: None
            }
        )
        ```
